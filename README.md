Hi there, hello!

I'm a versatile programmer skilled in C/C++, Java, Python, and proficient in project development and documentation. My expertise extends to Flutter & Dart, SQL, and various development platforms including PyCharm, Android Studio, Eclipse, and VS Code.

I have a strong focus on Flutter-based projects, but my work spans across other languages and frameworks such as Python and React. My GitHub showcases a few of my projects that showcase my capabilities in building functional cross-platform applications.
